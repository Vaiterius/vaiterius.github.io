                    Hi, my name is Gerard. I'm 19 and I'm a passionate learner and computer science student currently
                    studying at College of the Canyons. I aim to complete my associate's degree here and transfer out
                    to a university and obtain my bachelor's of science degree all while trying to score a couple
                    junior dev internship positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In school, I didn't even know what I wanted to be, that is, until I one day tried out
                    programming out of curiosity in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. I started out with
                    Python and I quickly grew invested with coding, creating tons of projects, and eventually
                    I thought - this is what I want to do! I am especially considerate about writing clean,
                    readable, and efficient code, among other things I strive upon as an aspiring software
                    engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can look into more detail about my programming experience in the experiences section of this
                    website, but mainly I am more interested in working with algorithms and data structures than
                    anything else. I have also dabbled with game development concepts and website development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have many interests and my personal life is fulfilled with many hobbies that I enjoy doing.
                    In my free time, I like to work on programming projects (such as this website! although this
                    is for CS50x problem set 8), play various
                    videogames, jam on my guitars, or do a little archery on the weekends.
